## Structured data

I will start by working with data that is already in a structured format. One common way that structured data can be acquired is through R packages via **Automatic Programming Interfaces (APIs)**. 

Here are a few potential R packages that have API access to structure text data: 

- `gutenbergr`
- `rtweet`
- `newsanchor`
- *etc.*

## Semi-structured data

## Un-structured data
