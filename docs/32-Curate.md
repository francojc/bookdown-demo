... introduction, and outline of the chapter... 

First steps in formating data that is conducive for quantitative research. It is important to make a distinction between two types of data that we are typically working with in text analysis: linguistic and non-linguistic data. 

Linguistic data is the text that we are aiming to analyze. 

Non-linguistic data, or **metadata**, is the data that we aim to associate with the linguistic data. Non-linguistic variables are tightly related to the type of text. For example, in text acquired from one-on-one interviews, non-linguistic variables may include information about the speakers' gender, age, language background, etc.
